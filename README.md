# Account Creation Validator
A JavaScript day-project for brushing up on regexes and handling the oh-so common feature of user account creation.

## Usage
All that's necessary to run this project is quite literally just to *pull the repo.*

## About
The project utilizes a regex and HTML5 standards to check:
* Empty email and/or password fields
* Matching email and password fields
* Invalidly formatted email and password fields
* Mismatched password verification

As mentioned, I wanted to make this project to brush up on my knowledge of regexes because I hadn't used them in a while.
Plus, I like web design a lot, so I figure an account creation page is something I should be able to create.

## Preview
Here's what the page looks like:
